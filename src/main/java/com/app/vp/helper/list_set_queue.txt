In practice, programming is usually done at the sub-interface level.

Collection interface: List<E>, Set<E> or Queue<E>, which have the following specifications:

• List<E> – list – models a resizable array,
for which index access is allowed. The list may contain repeating elements.
Commonly used List implementations are ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, and Stack.

• Set<E> – set – models a mathematical set,
Duplicate elements are not allowed. Often used implementations of the Set sub-interface are HashSet and LinkedHashSet.
The SortedSet<E> sub-interface models an ordered and sorted set of elements, implemented by TreeSet.

• Queue<E> – queue – models queues organized
according to the First-in-First-out (FIFO) principle - “first in, first out.” The Deque<E> sub-interface models queues,
which can be worked from both ends. Implementations include PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque, and LinkedList.
