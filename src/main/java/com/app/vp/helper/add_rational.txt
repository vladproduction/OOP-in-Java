Are crucial for adding two rational numbers. Let's break down what they do:

1. Adding Rational Numbers:

Imagine you have two rational numbers:

r1 = a / b (numerator: a, denominator: b)
r2 = c / d (numerator: c, denominator: d)
You want to find the sum, which can be written as:

r1 + r2 = (a / b) + (c / d)

2. Finding a Common Denominator:

To perform addition on fractions, they need to have a common denominator.
The common denominator in this case is the least common multiple (LCM) of b and d (denominators of r1 and r2).
However, for efficiency purposes, we can find the product of the existing denominators (b * d) which is always greater than or
equal to the LCM.

3. Calculating the New Numerator:

int newNumerator = numerator * other.denominator + other.numerator * denominator;

It multiplies the numerator of each rational number by the denominator of the other.
This essentially creates fractions with a denominator of (b * d) (product of existing denominators).
It adds these two newly formed fractions.
This effectively combines the numerators while ensuring a common denominator of (b * d).

4. New Denominator:

int newDenominator = denominator * other.denominator;

simply multiplies the existing denominators (b and d) together. This provides the common denominator for the resulting sum.

Putting it all Together:

By combining these steps, we get the sum of the two rational numbers with a common denominator and simplified terms
(using the normalize method from the class).

For example, if r1 = 1/2 and r2 = 2/3, the calculations would be:

newNumerator = (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) = 7
newDenominator = 2 * 3 = 6
Therefore, the sum of r1 and r2 would be a new rational number: 7/6.
The normalize method might further simplify this to 7/6 (already in its most reduced form) or 1
(if it divides both numerator and denominator by 1).
