UML Notation:
In UML notation, composition is denoted by like a line with a diamond-shaped arrow pointing to its components.
The diamond is always located on the side of the whole, and the simple line from the component side;
-a filled diamond indicates a stronger connection—composition;
-an open diamond indicates a weaker connection—aggregation.
