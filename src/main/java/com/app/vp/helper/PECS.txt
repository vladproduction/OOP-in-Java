PECS: "Producer Extends, Consumer Super".

"Producer Extends" - If you need a List to produce T values (you want to read Ts from the list),
you need to declare it with ? extends T, e.g. List<? extends Integer>. But you cannot add to this list.

"Consumer Super" - If you need a List to consume T values (you want to write Ts into the list),
you need to declare it with ? super T, e.g. List<? super Integer>. But there are no guarantees what type of object you may read from this list.

If you need to both read from and write to a list, you need to declare it exactly with no wildcards,
e.g. List<Integer>.
