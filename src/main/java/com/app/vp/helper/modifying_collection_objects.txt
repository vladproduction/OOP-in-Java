Ability to modify objects in the collection
The improved for loop offers a convenient way
to iterate through the elements of the collection. However, it hides the interface
Iterator, therefore you can NOT delete (via Iterator.
remove()) or replace elements.
On the other hand, since the loop variable receives a cloned copy as an object reference, improved
The for statement can be used to modify "mutating" elements (such as StringBuilder) using references to "cloned" objects,
but it cannot
modify “non-mutable” (unchangeable) elements
(such as String and base class wrappers) because new references are created.
